# Py-AutoLab

A personal lab of small Python automation and infrastructure projects, all built from scratch by me.  
Each project focuses on practical system thinking: logs, monitoring, DevOps, and tooling logic.

---

This repository is my **personal engineering playground**, where I experiment with:
- Infrastructure-focused scripting (log analyzers, monitors, CLI tools)
- Python automation for real-world scenarios
- System-oriented thinking: file I/O, metrics, parsing, error handling
